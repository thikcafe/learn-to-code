## Type & Value:

- string vs array => string is immutable, and array is mutable

- array vs object => array is numeric & ordered, object is key(string only) - value pair & unordered (**using them that way**) 

- object vs map => object is key(string only) - value pair & unordered, [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)'s keys could be any value

- value vs ref => the only way to control is using **types** of value

> value: using *wrapper* object

> ref: creating *new* value
